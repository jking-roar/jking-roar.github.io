Started using jekyll for this section of the website.  I have no idea what I'm doing.
I created the /blog directory using `jekyll new blog` in the base directory.
I needed to use the command `jekyll build` in the correct directory (the /blog one) to see what would result.
Then I needed to use the command `jekyll serve` from that directory to see the site.


*  things with an [apostrophe][apostrophe] (') might look odd.
   *  Was solved when I served from the correct directory
